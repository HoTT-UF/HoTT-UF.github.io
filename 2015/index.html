    <h1>Workshop on Homotopy Type Theory / Univalent Foundations </h1>

    <p>June 29-30, 2015, Warsaw, Poland</p>
    <p>Collocated with <a href="http://rdp15.mimuw.edu.pl/index.php?site=tlca">RDP/TRA/TLCA 2015</a>.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Homotopy Type Theory/Univalent Foundations is a young area of
    logic, combining ideas from several established fields: the use of
    dependent type theory as a foundation for mathematics, informed by
    ideas and tools from abstract homotopy theory.</p>

    <p>One practical goal of the programme is to facilitate computer
    formalisation of mathematics in such logical systems.

    We aim to focus on that aspect: bringing together researchers on
    formalisation in UF/HoTT to discuss the various established and
    experimental proof assistants for it, the different libraries
    available (HoTT Coq, Unimath, HoTT-Agda, &hellip;), what logical
    features are convenient for the formalisation of “homotopical
    mathematics”, and how to make formalisation in HoTT/UF accessible
    and practical for mathematicians.</p>

        <h3>Benedikt Ahrens,
        <em>Models of Type Theory in Univalent Mathematics</em> </h3>

        <div class="description">
          The categorical semantics of type theory has been subject of research
          since the 1970s.
          A model of type theory is usually defined to be a category - modelling
          contexts and their morphisms - that is equipped with additional
          structure accounting for types and terms, and operations such as
          substitution.
          The type theory itself can be given such a structure of a model - in
          fact, the inductive structure of type theory entails that it is the
          initial such model in a suitable sense.
          Various definitions of models as "categories with extra structure" have
          been studied, amongst them
          - categories with families ;
          - categories with attributes ;
          - categories with display maps ;
          - comprehension categories.
          In a *set-theoretic* setting, the relationship between those concepts is
          well-known.
          In ongoing work with Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine and Vladimir Voevodsky, we
          try to understand the relation between these different notions in
          *univalent* mathematics, by exhibiting maps between the different types
          of such models and showing which are embeddings, equivalences, and so on.
          In this talk I will give an overview of the UniMath library, a library
          of univalent mathematics formalized using the proof assistant Coq, and
          of our formalization of models of type theory based on the UniMath
          library.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h3> Thorsten Altenkirch, <em>Univalence for Dummies?</em></h3>
      <div class="description">
        One of the central principles of Homotopy Type Theory is the
        univalence "axiom" which basically states that equivalent types are
        equal. But why is this sound? Both the setoid model and the groupoid
        model give us a limited form of univalence but how to scale it up?
        Are Kan complexes the right answer? Or cubical sets? I would like to
        discuss this question and I expect some useful input from the
        audience.
      </div>
      </li>
      </li><li><h3>Assia Mahboubi, <em> Coq Libraries for HoTT </em> </h3>
      <div class="description">
        Many investigations in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations
        have been simultaneously formalized and machine-checked in
        pre-existing (like Agda or Coq) or new (like Lean) proof assistants,
        possibly customized for this purpose. This results today in rather
        larger corpus of formal libraries, that require some care and
        maintenance from their authors in order to remain a robust and
        extensible socle for further developments. In this lecture we do not
        present new formalized results but rather try to illustrate how the
        techniques drawn up in the collaborative development of large
        libraries like the Mathematical Components can apply to this flavor of
        formalizations.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Matthieu Sozeau, <em> Coq support for HoTT</em></h3>
      <div class="description">In this tutorial I will present
      up-and-coming, definitional extensions for the development of
      HoTT in Coq. The first, a generalized rewriting framework
      working in Type, enables rewriting with equivalences, relevant
      identity or any user defined relevant rewriting relation in any
      context. The second, a work-in-progress update of the Equations
      package, enables full dependent pattern-matching syntax for
      writing programs, using general well-founded recursion and
      making use of the h-level information on types to compile
      pattern-matching down to pure, axiom-free Coq terms. It also
      provides tools to reason on programs after the fact without
      leaking details of the elaboration. In particular it derives
      powerful functional elimination principles coming from the the
      inductively defined graphs of functions. We will discuss
      potential applications and extensions with HITs.

      This is joint work with Cyprien Mangin.</div>

      </li><li><h3>Vladimir Voevodsky, <em>From Syntax to Semantics of Dependent Type Theories - formalized </em></h3>
      <div class="description">The keystone of the homotopy type
      theory and univalent foundations is the interpretation of the
      Calculus of Inductive Constructions into Kan simplicial sets
      that satisfies the univalence axiom. The detailed description of
      this interpretation is very complex and requires new level of
      generality and precision in the theory of syntax and semantics
      of dependent type theories. I will report on the current state
      of the program for a rigorous, formalizable approach to the
      construction of models of complex dependent type theories that I
      have been working on since 2009.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Format and schedule</h2>

  <p>The work shop will include invited talks, contributed talks, and a round-table discussion session.</p>

  <p>The discussion topic is the state of libraries and documentation for programming in HoTT using Coq and Agda.
  We hope to stimulate effort to make the existing resources more accessible, and improve and supplement them where they are lacking, to help new researchers get active in this topic.</p>

  <p>For practical details, registration, etc., see the <a href="http://rdp15.mimuw.edu.pl/index.php?site=tlca">main RDP site</a>.</p>

  <h2>Submissions</h2>

  <p><strong>Abstract submission deadline: April 15, 2015.</strong></p>

  <p>Submissions should consist of a title and abstract, in pdf or text format, via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hottuf15">EasyChair</a></p>

  <p>Talks on practical formalisation are particularly solicited, but submissions on all UF/HoTT topics are welcome.</p>
