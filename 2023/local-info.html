    <a href="venue.png">How to get there (map)</a>.

    <p><b>Roadblocks:</b> On Sunday, 23rd April 2023, is the Vienna City Marathon. Some roads are going to be closed and some forms of public transport will be unavailable. However, the ubahn (underground metro) should run smoothly during the event, so plan your route to the venue accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Getting to Vienna</h3>

    <h4>By Train</h4>
    The main train station of Vienna is called Wien Hauptbahnhof (commonly abbreviated as "Wien Hbf", translating to Vienna central station). It is directly connected to the underground line U1, as well as many other bus lines. The majority of trains in Austria are operated by the <a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/">ÖBB</a>.

    <h4>By Plane</h4>

    <p>The Vienna International Airport (VIE) is an international transport hub and is conveniently located close to the city.</p>

    <p>To get to the city center, you have the following options:</p>

    <p><b>Standard train conncection</b> (Schnellbahn S7) between the airport and Landstraße / Wien Mitte and Railjet between the airport and Wien Hauptbanhof (Vienna central station) are available (~30 minutes, tickets €4.20 one-way, including underground and bus in Vienna). Make sure to buy “2 zones” from the vending machine. If you buy a (time-based) transit pass for the city of Vienna at the same time, you only need “1 zone” (€2.10) to enter the city. </p>

    <p><b>The <a href="http://www.cityairporttrain.com/">City Airport Train (CAT)</a></b> links the airport to subway station Landstraße / Wien Mitte in 16 minutes where you can change to subway lines U3 and U4, as well as to tram and buses. If travelling on CAT, you can already check-in at the train station Wien Mitte for certain flights when departing from Vienna. The fare is 11€ for a one-way and 19€ for a return trip. Have a look at the timetable. Note that tickets for underground, trams, or local buses are not included in this fare.</p>

    <p><b>Airport Bus Shuttle</b>: There are regular buses running from the airport to:
        <ul>
            <li>Wien Hauptbahnhof (Vienna central station), connection to underground line U1 and several trams and buses.</li>
            <li>Wien Westbahnhof, connection to underground lines U3 and U6.</li>
            <li>Morzinplatz/Schwedenplatz, city centre, connection to underground line U1, U4.</li>
        </ul>

    The bus station is located directly in front of the airport arrival hall. Buses leave every 20 to 30 minutes. It takes around 30 minutes to get to Vienna by bus. Tickets (8 euros) are available on the bus or at the self-service ticket machines. Please note that the tickets are only valid for the shuttle bus, and not for public transportation in Vienna.</p>

    <p><b>Taxi</b>: The taxi stand at the airport is located in front of the arrival hall. It takes about half an hour to get to the city centre (approx. 36 euros).</p>

    <h4>By car</h4>
    <p>All vehicles with a maximum weight of up to 3.5 t (e.g. motor bikes, cars) require a so-called “vignette” toll sticker to travel on Austrian motorways and expressways. You can buy a digital sticker online at the <a href="https://www.asfinag.at/en/toll/vignette/">ASFiNAG webpage</a> or you can obtain a physical sticker at local petrol stations, post offices, newsagents, and Automobile Clubs. You can also purchase stickers in Austria's neighbouring countries at petrol stations, borders, and Automobile Clubs.</p>

    <p>Parking in Vienna: You can park your vehicle at a park + ride garage options, such as:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.apcoa.at/en/parking/vienna/p-r-erdberg-vienna-apcoa/">Erdberg</a>, connection to underground line U3.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.parkopedia.at/parken/parkhaus/hauptbahnhof_ost_1/1100/wien/?arriving=202212151400&leaving=202212151600">Wien Hauptbahnhof Ost 1</a>, connection to the U1 underground line, as well as several tram and bus lines.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Local transport in Vienna</h3>

    <p>
        Vienna has an excellent public transport system. A public transport ticket for the city of Vienna (Zone 100 or Kernzone) is valid for any subway, tram, or bus operated by Wiener Linien and trains operated by ÖBB and WLB.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are several kinds of tickets: A ticket for a single trip costs €2.10 and can be used for any single trip within Vienna. You may change lines, but must not interrupt your journey. There are also transit passes for one or several days that may be more convinient. You can purchase tickets at a machine at every underground stop and also via the <a href="https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en/mobile-tickets">WienMobil app</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can reach the university via the following lines:
        <ul>
            <li>Subway U1 at Taubstummengasse.</li>
            <li>Subway U2, U4 at Karlsplatz.</li>
            <li>Tram line D at Gußhausstraße.</li>

    <h3>Tipping</h3>
    In many service areas, such as restaurants, taxis, hairdressers, serviced filling stations, etc., a tip is traditionally given. This is normally 5 to 10 percent, with the exact amount depending on the level of satisfaction with the service provided. You can also tip while paying by card: when a service provider (e.g. a waiter) tells a number due to pay, you say a higher number that includes the total cost plus tip, and you pay the amount you said.

    <h3>Shopping</h3>
    Shops are usually open Mon - Fri from 9.00 am - 6.30 pm, Sat until 5.00 pm or 6.00 pm; some shopping centers are open until 8.00 pm or 9.00 from Mon-Fri.

    Shopping on Sundays and holidays is available only at the large railway stations, at the airport and in the museum shops.

    <h3>Electricity</h3>
    In Austria the power sockets are of type F. The standard voltage is 230 V and the standard frequency is 50 Hz.
