Title: Enriched graphs with applications to organic chemistry and trees

Abstract: When you define a concept in univalent mathematics, you do so by defining the type of all objects in that concept.
Furthermore, the univalence axiom can then be used to characterize the identity types of objects in that concept.
In univalent combinatorics we seek to take advantage of the univalence axiom in order to count combinatorial objects up to isomorphism.
Sometimes, however, we want to break symmetries. For example, while a carbon atom in 3-space has four free electrons,
its symmetry group is not the 4th symmetric group but it is the 4-th alternating group. In this talk I will present the notion
of enriched undirected graphs, where graphs are enriched with further structure that can be used to break the symmetries of odd sign on a carbon atom.
I will show how the notion of enriched undirected graphs can be used to define the type of hydrocarbons in univalent mathematics.
The same idea of enrichment can be used to directed graphs
and we will show that elements of W-types are precisely such enriched trees.
