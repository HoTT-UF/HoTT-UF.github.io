    <h1>Workshop on Homotopy Type Theory/ Univalent Foundations</h1>

    <p>Aarhus, Denmark, June 1&ndash;2, 2026</p>

    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>At the HoTT/UF Workshop we strive to ensure that participants enjoy a
      welcoming environment. We seek to foster an atmosphere that encourages the
      free expression and exchange of ideas. We support equality of opportunity and
      treatment for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity or
      expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious
      belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or disabilities.</p>

    <p>Harassment is a form of misconduct that undermines the integrity of HoTT/UF
      Workshop activities and mission.</p>

    <p>Violations may be reported confidentially to the organizers of the
      workshop.</p>

    <h3>Understanding Harassment</h3>

    <p>
      Harassment is belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual
      or a group of people. This conduct may include, but is not limited to:
      epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or
      hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or
      graphic material that disparages or shows hostility or aversion toward an
      individual or group.
    </p>

    <p>
      Harassment also refers to bullying or coercion of a sexual nature. Sexual
      harassment can include offensive remarks about a personâ€™s gender, gender
      identity, or sexual preference. Harassment may include unwelcome or
      inappropriate promises of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. The following
      are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual
      harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; unnecessary
      touching; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually
      degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually
      suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to be aware of discomfort or offense that words or actions may
      cause. A teasing comment or offhand remark that may be inoffensive to some may
      be perceived as harassment by others. Consequently, individuals must act to
      ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others, in light
      of the international and multicultural nature of the HoTT/UF community. Those
      in positions of authority must be especially mindful of this policy since
      individuals with lower rank or a subordinate position may be reluctant to
      express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.
