Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types represent
categories, generalizing groupoids. In our prior work, we defined a constructive
model of directed type theory in bicubical sets. For this talk, I will describe our
current work in progress in which we extend this generalization to inductive
types: Just as higher inductive types allow one to inductively define types using
path constructors, directed higher inductive types will additionally allow one to do
so using morphism constructors. (joint work with Dan Licata)
