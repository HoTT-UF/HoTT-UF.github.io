Title: The (∞,1)-category of Types

Abstract:
A major outstanding difficulty in Homotopy Type Theory is the
description of coherent higher algebraic structures.  As an example,
we know that the algebraic structure possessed by the collection of
types and functions between them is *not* a traditional 1-category,
but rather an (∞,1)-category.  In this talk, I will describe how the
addition of a finite collection additional definitional equalities
designed to render the notion of "opetopic type" definable in fact
allows one to construct the (∞,1)-category structure on the universe
of types.
