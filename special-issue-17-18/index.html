                in association with the workshops on</br>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    
    <p>
      Homotopy Type Theory is a young research area combining ideas from
      several established fields: the use of dependent type theory as a
      foundation for mathematics, inspired by ideas and tools from abstract
      homotopy theory and higher category theory. Univalent Foundations
      are foundations of mathematics based on the homotopical interpretation
      of type theory. These ideas have led to a lot of interesting
      developments, from the study of syntax and semantics of type theories
      to practical formalizations in proof assistants based on univalent
      type theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HoTT/UF Workshop started out as a forum for formalization of 
      mathematics in the univalent style. From the 2017 edition onwards,
      its scope has been broadened to encompass all aspects of (homotopy)
      type theory and univalent foundations, in particular (but not
      exclusively):

    <ul>
      <li>semantics of (univalent) type theory,
      <li>computational content of the univalence axiom,
      <li>synthetic homotopy theory, and
      <li>formalization in HoTT and UF.
    </ul>
    </p>

    The 2017 edition of the workshop is colocated with FSCD'17, taking
    place in September 2017 in Oxford, UK. The 2018 edition is colocated
    with FSCD'18 and part of FLoC'18 in July 2018 in Oxford, UK.


    <h2>Special issue</h2>

    We are soliciting submissions for a Special Issue of the journal

    <center><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science"><b>Mathematical Structures in Computer Science</b></a> 
            </br>(Cambridge University Press)</center>


    edited in association with the 2017 and 2018 editions of the HoTT/UF
    workshop.
    <b>Submission is open to everyone</b> and not limited to workshop participants.
    
    <p>
    Submission is open from now and <b>submissions will be reviewed on a rolling
    basis</b>, as soon as they are received. 
    Accepted papers will be published on the MSCS website via 'FirstView' and 
    will be citeable through a DOI shortly after acceptance - before the 
    completion of the whole journal issue (expected end of 2019).
    Submission deadline will be on December 31, 2018.
    </p>

    </ul>


    <h2>Details</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Papers must be submitted in pdf through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hottufspecialissue17">EasyChair</a>.

      <li> Authors have the option to attach to their submission a zip or tgz
  file containing code (formalized proofs or programs).
  Publication of such code together with the article can be arranged
  if desired by the authors.

      <li> Submission deadline will be on <b>December 31, 2018</b>.
           (However, as mentioned above, submissions will be handled
           as soon as they are received.)

      <li> We recommend submissions have no more than <b>40
           pages</b>. For longer articles we ask authors to provide a
           justification for exceeding this limit.
        
      <li> Final versions of accepted submissions will need to be prepared
  according to the
	<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/information/instructions-contributors">MSCS guidelines</a>.
      <li> If you have any questions or remarks, please send an email to <a href="mailto:hottufspecialissue1718@easychair.org">the dedicated Easychair address</a>
           or to one of the editors directly.
