		       Open call for papers</br>
                      for a Special Issue of</br>

            Mathematical Structures in Computer Science</br>

                in association with the workshops on</br>

           Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations</br>
                       HoTT/UF 2017-2018
    </center>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    The HoTT/UF Workshop started out as a forum for formalization of 
    mathematics in the univalent style. From the 2017 edition onwards,
    its scope has been broadened to encompass all aspects of (homotopy)
    type theory and univalent foundations, in particular (but not
    exclusively)

    <ul>
      <li>semantics of (univalent) type theory
      <li>computational content of the univalence axiom
      <li>synthetic homotopy theory
      <li>formalization in HoTT and UF
    </ul>

    The 2017 edition of the workshop is colocated with FSCD'17, taking
    place in September 2017 in Oxford, UK. The 2018 edition is colocated
    with FSCD'18 and part of FLoC'18 in July 2018 in Oxford, UK.


    <h2>Special issue</h2>

    We are soliciting submissions for a Special Issue of the journal

    <center><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science"><b>Mathematical Structures in Computer Science</b></a> 
            </br>(Cambridge University Press)</center>


    edited in association with the 2017 and 2018 editions of the HoTT/UF
    workshop.
    <b>Submission is open to everyone</b> and not limited to workshop participants.
    
    <p>
    Submission is open from now and <b>submissions will be reviewed on a rolling
    basis</b>, as soon as they are received. 
    Accepted papers will be published on the MSCS website via 'FirstView' and 
    will be citeable through a DOI shortly after acceptance - before the 
    completion of the whole journal issue (expected end of 2019).
    </p>

    <h2> Guest editors</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Benedikt Ahrens
      <li>Simon Huber
      <li>Anders MÃ¶rtberg
    </ul>


    <h2>Details</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Papers must be submitted in pdf through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hottufspecialissue17">EasyChair</a>.

      <li> Authors have the option to attach to their submission a zip or tgz
  file containing code (formalized proofs or programs).
  Publication of such code together with the article can be arranged
  if desired by the authors.

      <li>Submission deadline will be on December 31, 2018.
  (However, as mentioned above, submissions will be handled as soon
  as they are received.)

      <li> Final versions of accepted submissions will need to be prepared
  according to the
	<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/information/instructions-contributors">MSCS guidelines</a>.
    </ul>
