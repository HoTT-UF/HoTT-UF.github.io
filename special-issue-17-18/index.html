    <h2>Background</h2>


    <p>
      Homotopy Type Theory is a young research area combining ideas
      from several established fields: the use of dependent type
      theory as a foundation for mathematics, inspired by ideas and
      tools from abstract homotopy theory and higher category
      theory. Univalent Foundations are foundations of mathematics
      based on the homotopical interpretation of type theory. These
      ideas have led to many interesting developments, from the study
      of syntax and semantics of type theories to practical
      formalizations in proof assistants based on univalent type
      theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HoTT/UF workshops, co-located with FSCD since 2016, started
      out as a forum for formalization of mathematics in a univalent
      setting. From the 2017 edition and onwards, its scope has been
      broadened to encompass all aspects of Homotopy Type Theory and
      Univalent Foundations, in particular (but not exclusively):

    <ul>
      <li>semantics of (univalent) type theory,
      <li>computational content of the univalence axiom,
      <li>syntax and semantics of higher inductive types,
      <li>synthetic homotopy theory, and
      <li>formalization of mathematics and computer science in
          Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Special issue</h2>

    We are soliciting submissions for a Special Issue of the journal

    <p>
    <center><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science">Mathematical Structures in Computer Science</a>
            </br>(Cambridge University Press)</center>
    </p>

    edited in association with the 2017 and 2018 editions of the
    HoTT/UF workshop. <b>Submission is open to everyone</b> and not
    limited to workshop participants.

    <p>
    Submission is open from now and submissions will be reviewed on
    a <b>rolling basis</b>, as soon as they are received. Accepted
    papers will be published on the MSCS website via 'FirstView' and
    will be citeable through a DOI shortly after acceptance - before
    the completion of the whole journal issue (expected end of 2019).
    Submission will be closed on December 31, 2018.

           Foundations"</b> from the drop down menu on the submissions
           page. Please also choose <b>Pierre-Louis Curien</b> as
           editor-in-chief for the submission.
        
      <li> Detailed submission instructions and MSCS guidelines to
           which the final versions of accepted papers need to follow
           can be found
           <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/information/instructions-contributors">here</a>.

      <li> The LaTeX template can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk/pub/texarchive/journals/latex/mscs-cls/unpacked/">here</a>.

      <li> Authors have the option to attach to their submission a zip
           or tgz file containing code (formalized proofs or
           programs). Publication of such code together with the
           article can be arranged if desired by the authors.

      <li> Submission will be closed on <b>December 31, 2018</b>.
           (However, as mentioned above, submissions will be handled
           as soon as they are received.)

      <li> We recommend submissions have no more than <b>40 pages</b>.
           For longer articles we ask authors to provide a
           justification for exceeding this limit.

      <li> If you have any questions or remarks, please send an email
           to the guest editors.
