# Title
Strict Rezk completions of models of type theory

# Abstract

In this talk I'll present the main ideas of my new proof of homotopy canonicity
for HoTT (see arXiv:2311.05849).

Constructive models of HoTT, such as cubical set models, provide a computational
interpretation of the univalence axiom. Homotopy canonicity, originally
conjectured by Voevodsky, implies that the computational content of univalence
can already be observed in the syntax.

Canonicity results are usually proven using a sconing construction, gluing
together the syntax and a semantic model. For homotopy canonicity, the semantic
model should be a model of HoTT, say cubical sets. To carry out the sconing
construction, the components of the base model should also be cubical sets with
the correct higher dimensional structure. However the components of the syntax
are only sets, which can be seen as discrete cubical sets, with the "wrong"
higher dimensional structure.

This can be solved by constructing the "strict Rezk completion" of the syntax,
which is an equivalent model with the correct higher dimensional
structure. Strict Rezk completions can be constructed in cartesian cubical sets.
