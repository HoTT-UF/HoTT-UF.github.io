    <h1>Workshop on Homotopy Type Theory/ Univalent Foundations</h1>

    <img src="floc_2018_pos_rgb.png" alt="FLoC18" width="100" align="right">

    <p>July 7-8, 2018, Oxford, United Kingdom.</p>

    <p>Co-located with
       <a href="http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/events/fscd2018/">FSCD 2018</a>
       and part of <a href="http://www.floc2018.org/">FLoC 2018</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Homotopy Type Theory is a young area of logic, combining ideas
       from several established fields: the use of dependent type
       theory as a foundation for mathematics, inspired by ideas and
       tools from abstract homotopy theory. Univalent Foundations are
       foundations of mathematics based on the homotopical
       interpretation of type theory.
    </p>

    <p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers
       interested in all aspects of Homotopy Type Theory/Univalent
       Foundations: from the study of syntax and semantics of type
       theory to practical formalization in proof assistants based on
       univalent type theory.
    </p>


    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p>The workshop will include invited and contributed talks, and
       possibly a discussion session (depending on scheduling and
       interest).
    </p>

    <p>Details regarding registration and accommodation will be
       announced in due course. For all other practical details see
       the main <a href="http://www.floc2018.org/">FLoC site</a>.
       FLoC also provides
       <a href="http://www.floc2018.org/travel-stipend/">travel
       stipends</a> with application deadline <b>May 18</b>.

    <h3>Invited speakers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Martín Escardó (University of Birmingham):
        <b>Injective types and searchable types in univalent mathematics</b>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> We characterize the injective types as the
        retracts of exponential powers of the universes. The injective
        (n+1)-types are the retracts of the universes of n-types, and
        in particular the injective sets are the retracts of
        powersets. We apply this to construct searchable types, with
        the property that every decidable subset has an infimum in a
        transitive, extensional order. This applies Yoneda-style
        machinery for types seen as infty-groupoids.</p>

      <li>Paige North (Ohio State University), joint with
        <a href="http://hdra.gforge.inria.fr/">HDRA</a>: <b>TBA</b>
        <p><b>Abstract: TBA</b></p>
      </li>
      <li>Andrew Pitts (University of Cambridge):
        <b>Axiomatizing Cubical Sets Models of Univalent Foundations</b>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> The constructive model of Homotopy Type
          Theory introduced by Cohen-Coquand-Huber-Mörtberg in 2015
          (building on the work of Bezem-Coquand-Huber in 2013) uses a
          particular presheaf topos of cubical sets. It is arguably
          one of the most significant contributions to constructive
          mathematics since Martin-Löf's work in the 1970s. Since its
          introduction, much effort has been expended to analyse,
          simplify and generalize what makes this model of the
          univalence axiom tick, using a variety of techniques. In
          this talk I will describe an axiomatic approach -- the
          isolation of a few elementary axioms about an interval and a
          universe of fillable shapes that allow a univalent universe
          to be constructed. Not all the axioms are visible in the
          original work; and the axioms can be satisfied in toposes
          other than the original presheaf topos of cubical sets.  The
          axioms and constructions can almost be expressed in
          Extensional Martin-Löf Type Theory, except that the global
          nature of some of them leads to the use of a modal extension
          of that language.

          This is joint work with Ian Orton, Dan Licata and Bas Spitters.</p>
